# SunnyDaysAhead

## Project Objective
Sunny Days Ahead is a website I designed as my Capstone Project to connect users with adoptable pets in their area using the Petfinder API. The website aims to provide a user-friendly interface for searching, viewing, and learning about available pets.

### Features
Some are still being implemented, but they are as follows:
1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
2. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved).
3. Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.  Basic math functions donâ€™t count (e.g. addition, etc).
4. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
5. Create a node.js web server using a modern framework such as Express.js or Fastify.  Serve at least one route that your app uses (must serve more than just the index.html file).

#### In order to run, open srcServer, rightclick and hit Run Code.
