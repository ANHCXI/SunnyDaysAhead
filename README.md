# SunnyDaysAhead

## Project Objective
Sunny Days Ahead is a website I designed as my Capstone Project to connect users with adoptable pets in their area using the Petfinder API. The website aims to provide a user-friendly interface for searching, viewing, and learning about available pets. You can search by name, age, gender, breed, and zipcode. After clicking search, three random animals will populate the slots and so will their information. Their names become a clickable link to their pages on Petfinder.

### Features
Some are still being implemented, but they are as follows:

1. Use arrays, objects, sets, or maps to store and retrieve information.
2. Analyze data stored in arrays, objects, sets, or maps and display information.
3. Use a regular expression to validate user input.
4. Analyze text and display useful information.
5. Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters.
6. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.


#### In order to run, navigate over to srcServer.js. I use an extension called 'CodeRunner' on Visual Studio Code. Install the extension, rightclick and hit 'Run Code.' You may need to install node.js and NPM.
